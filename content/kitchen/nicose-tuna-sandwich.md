#### Steps

1. Pickled shallots: You can do this before for more pickled goodness. The longer the better.

    - Find a old jar with a lid.
    - Chop up the shallot into stringy pieces.
    - Add into the jar and shake:
        - 2 tsp of white sugar
        - 3 tbsp of lemon juice
        - Stringy shallot pieces

2. Take a pot, fill it with water, a generous pinch of salt and bring it to the boil.
3. While we are waiting for the water come to the boil, let's make a spread:

   - Take a small pot or cup, add the mayonnaise, smoked paprika and mix it.
   - Add a pinch of kosher salt.
   - Add some lemon juice to thin it out.
   - Taste and add adjust to your liking.

4. Once the water is boiling, carefully lower the two eggs.

   - Set a timer for 7 mins — I like them runny.

5. While the eggs are cooking, pull out a pan to toast the bread rolls.

    - Slice the rolls in half.
    - Put the pan on medium heat.
    - Wait till the eggs are nearly done first ~ 2 minute before it is ready.
    - Toast the halved bread rolls ~ 30s should be enough.

6. Take the eggs and let them cool.
7. Take toasted bread rolls and apply the spread on both halves — be generous.
8. Add a layer of tuna flakes to the bottom half of the roll.
9. Cut the eggs into slices and place them over the tuna.
10. Season the eggs with some black pepper.
11. Add a layer of the pickled shallots.
12. Add a layer of the sliced black olives.
13. Garnish with some pieces of dill.
14. Lightly apply some olive oil.
15. Apply the top half of the rolls.
