#### Steps

1. Get a large pot, add water, a large pinch of salt and then bring it to the boil.
2. While the water is coming to the boil:

   - Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into halves.
   - Cut the block of feta into small cubes.
   - Finely cut the parsley ~ throw away the stalks.

3. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and let it cook:

   - Turn the heat down to medium.
   - Set the timer to 1 min less than the time on the pasta packet ~ al dente.

4. Once the pasta is cooked, drain the water and add the pasta back to the pot.
5. Add the spicy sun-dried tomato pesto and mix it through.
6. Add the remaining ingredients one by one (cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, olives and parsley) and mix it through well.
