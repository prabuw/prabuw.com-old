Hello! My name is Prabu Weerasinghe.

I am a software engineer based in London, UK. </br>
I am interested in software, product strategy and engineering management.

I am originally from Sri Lanka but moved around with my family. I have lived in Indonesia, Singapore and Australia.
While London is where I am based, Sydney will always be home.

Aside from tech, I am interested in [cooking](/cooking), [football](http://www.arsenal.com), [running](/running) and [travelling](/photos).
