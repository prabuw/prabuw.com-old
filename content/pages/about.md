Hello! My name is Prabu Weerasinghe.

I am a software engineer based in London, UK. </br>
I am interested in software, product strategy and engineering management.

I am originally from Sri Lanka but moved around with my family. I have lived in Indonesia, Singapore and Australia.
While London is where I am based, Sydney will always be home.

Aside from tech, I am interested in [cooking](/cooking), [football](http://www.arsenal.com), [running](/running) and [travelling](/photos).

This blog is a place for me to capture my _random_ thoughts, [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) and put a flag down on a tiny corner on the _interwebs_.

The site is a heavily customised version of the [gatsby advanced starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter/) theme.
The design of this site is inspired by the following:

- [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)
- [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/me/)
- [Victor Zhou](https://victorzhou.com/about/)
